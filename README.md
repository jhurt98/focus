Focus CLI Proxy

CLI Tool that starts a proxy to block connections to specified sites

Depends on existing certificate authority and key files generated by the mkcert tool
- This is only used to spin a TLS server that accepts our local CA on https requests of blocked sites so our proxy server can interecept and return a custom response
- allowed sites do not create a TLS server and instead creates a blind tunnel between the client and server

Only tested on firefox by configuring the proxy in network settings
